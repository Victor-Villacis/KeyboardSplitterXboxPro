//! The MACHINE verbs: the operations docs/CONTROL-SURFACE.md enumerates that
//! are neither a `DaemonCommand` nor a preset write — devices, pads, presets,
//! autostart, doctor, WinUSB.
//!
//! They are here for the same reason [`crate::ControlSource`] is: a native
//! shell, the MCP shim and Studio must reach them through ONE typed surface,
//! or each grows its own JSON and the standing rule ("every front-door action
//! maps to an existing backend verb") becomes a thing reviewers enforce by
//! reading.
//!
//! **Status, stated plainly: this is the typed surface, and nothing implements
//! it yet.** Every method is defaulted, and every default is a WORDED refusal
//! naming the command that does work — never a silent no-op, never an empty
//! view that looks like real data. That is exactly what CONTROL-SURFACE's own
//! column says about these rows today ("M9: same verb in-process. M10: api"):
//! the CLI is the front door, and a surface asking through this trait is told
//! so, per call, with the line to type.
//!
//! The reads (devices, presets, autostart, doctor, WinUSB status) are
//! daemon-free and safe from anywhere, so ksx-app can implement them the day a
//! surface consumes them — the shapes below are what it would fill in. The
//! mutating and elevated ones are a different question and not merely
//! unimplemented: a pad test COMPETES for the four XInput slots, and `winusb
//! claim`/`release` can leave a panel that no longer types. Those keep the
//! CLI's dry-run-first consent shape, and the refusal says which command
//! carries it.
//!
//! Writing the trait before the implementations is deliberate, and it is the
//! cheap half: it fixes the vocabulary (one `DevicesView`, not one per
//! surface), and it means the first consumer adds a provider instead of
//! inventing a second JSON shape on its way to the same collectors.
